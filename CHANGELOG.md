# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- `CommitHookException`: the transaction is committed, but a `transaction.commit` hook failed or the connection state could not be verified or cleaned up after a hook. `getPrevious()` is the first failure, `$failures` lists all of them.

### Changed
- All `transaction.commit` hooks run, even if one throws, and their failures arrive together as `CommitHookException`. Hooks are independent: dependent steps belong in one hook.
- A failure after the commit no longer causes a rollback attempt. A transaction left open by a commit hook is now reported as a failure (`CommitHookException`, even if no hook threw; 1.0 returned normally) and rolled back directly, without `transaction.rollback` hooks; if that fails (or the connection state cannot be read), the remaining commit hooks are skipped.
- Migration: a failing commit hook's exception no longer surfaces unwrapped; catch `CommitHookException` and read `getPrevious()`. It extends `DatabaseException`, not `TransactionException`; catch it before a broad `catch (DatabaseException)`.

### Fixed
- `transaction()` and `updateMultiple()` attempted a rollback after a successful commit when a commit hook threw (firing `transaction.rollback` if the hook had left its own transaction open).
- A `PDOException` thrown by a commit hook was reported as "Failed to commit transaction".
- `commit()` ignored `PDO::commit()` returning `false` (non-exception error mode) and ran the commit hooks; it now throws `TransactionException`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Connection layer** with MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite drivers.
  - Configuration via array or environment variables (`$_ENV`, `getenv()`).
  - PDO options with sensible defaults (exceptions, associative fetch, real prepared statements).
- **Query execution** with `query()` and `execute()` methods.
  - Prepared statements with parameter binding.
  - Query duration tracking.
- **Transaction support** with `beginTransaction()`, `commit()`, `rollback()`.
  - `transaction()` helper with auto-commit/rollback.
  - Rollback failures do not mask the original exception.
- **Event hooks** for query logging and error handling.
  - Events: `query`, `error`, `transaction.begin`, `transaction.commit`, `transaction.rollback`.
- **CRUD helper methods**:
  - `insert()` - Insert row and return last insert ID.
  - `update()` - Update rows with WHERE conditions (safety check).
  - `delete()` - Delete rows with WHERE conditions (safety check).
  - `findOne()` - Find single row by conditions.
  - `findAll()` - Find all rows matching conditions.
  - `updateMultiple()` - Batch update by key column within a transaction.
- **Fluent QueryBuilder**:
  - `select()`, `distinct()`
  - `where()`, `whereIn()`, `whereNotIn()`, `whereBetween()`, `whereNotBetween()`
  - `whereNull()`, `whereNotNull()`, `whereLike()`, `whereNotLike()`
  - `join()`, `leftJoin()`, `rightJoin()`
  - `orderBy()`, `limit()`, `offset()`
  - `groupBy()`, `having()`
  - `get()`, `first()`, `exists()`
  - `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`
  - `insert()`, `update()`, `delete()`
  - `toSql()` for debugging.
- **`Database::raw()`** for explicit raw SQL expressions (aggregates, complex queries).
- **Security**:
  - Operator whitelist validation.
  - Identifier quoting with proper escaping.
  - Safety checks preventing UPDATE/DELETE without WHERE.
- **Exception hierarchy**: `DatabaseException`, `ConnectionException`, `QueryException`, `TransactionException`.
- **PostgreSQL**: `insert()` uses `RETURNING id` for reliable ID retrieval.
- **SQLite**: Foreign key constraints enabled by default.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions with PHP 8.2-8.5, MySQL 8.0/8.4, MariaDB 10.11/11.4, PostgreSQL 15/16/17.
- **Quality**: PHPStan level 9, PHP-CS-Fixer (PSR-12).
